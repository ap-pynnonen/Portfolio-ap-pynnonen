The target was to visualize the traffic volumes and speeds of road traffic and develop an application to visualize the LAM station road traffic data. The client of the Thesis was JAMK University of Applied Sciences and Tieto tuottamaan project.",
    "thesispara3": "Visualization application was developed with JavaScript’s React framework. Finland’s map was added to the applications main view with react-simple-maps components and LAM-datapoint markers were added to the map. Visualization view needed to be opened and closed so that function was added to map markers. A column chart was added to visualization view with React Google charts to visualize LAM-datapoint data. LAM-datapoint selection was added to map markers along with automatic Digitraffic API call for data. Column chart speed column selection was added to visualize selected speed with that driven speeds time of day.",
